# Important: How to set up local development environment

## Install nvm

### Windows

Download the Zip (nvm-noinstall.zip)
[HERE](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/releases)

### Mac

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.1/install.sh | bash
```

## Provision nodejs

```bash
nvm install 20.11.1
nvm use 20.11.1
```

## Install nodemon globally

```bash
npm install -g nodemon
```

## setup frontend react project

```bash
cd ./frontend
npm install
```

## setup backend node project

```bash
cd ../backend
npm install
```

## Install Docker Desktop

### Windows

Follow the instruction [HERE](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/#:~:text=Download%20the%20installer%20using%20the,Program%20Files%5CDocker%5CDocker%20)

### Mac

# 4. How to run frontend react, backend node, mongodb in dev mode or as docker containers

## 1. Run mongodb & wiremock(docker-compose)

Run this from Git Bash if you use Windows

```bash
# In a new shell, and keep this shell opened
cd ./backend
npm run start:dep
```

#Verify the env,
Open http://localhost:8080/db/admin/ in your browser, and login with dev/dev

## 2. Run frontend react

```bash
cd ./frontend
npm run dev
```

## 3. Run backend node

```bash
cd ./backend
npm start
# (starts node server at `localhost:3000`)
```

## MongoDB

## Login to MongoDB

1. default username: devroot
1. default password: devroot
1. default database: cs732

## Login to MongoDB Admin Portal

http://localhost:8080/db/admin/

Username: `dev`, Password:`dev`

---

### Verify the instance of the image is up and running

1. Visit the backend: http://localhost:8001/api/users
2. Visit the frontend: http://localhost:8000/
3. Visit mongodb admin portal: http://localhost:8080 with username: dev, password: dev

# How to test the code

## Frontend unit tests

1. `cd ./frontend`
2. `npm test`

## Backend unit tests

1. `cd ./backend`
2. `npm test`

## Backend api integration tests

1. spin up backend node.
2. spin up mongodb database through docker-compose

```
cd ./backend
npm run test:e2e
```

You can also manually test APIs with swagger UI

1. go to http://localhost:3000/api/api-docs
2. view and call apis for testing

## Testing AWS CDK infrastructure as code

We currently put dev and prod stacks all in one account but you can test deploying the stack with your own suffix.
You need to reachout to Mark(mzhu929) for giving you permission to access AWS console and deploying stacks as this is his personal AWS account.

```bash
cd ./infrastructure
npm run deploy-dev
```

## Wiremock

Put your mock files under `deployment/wiremock/__files` and `deployment/wiremock/mappings`

Refere the `json` example here: https://wiremock.org/docs/stubbing/

## Browser end-to-end tests

### Note that we support only `Chrome` at this time

### Prerequisite

install playwright and chromium

```bash
npx playwright install --with-deps chromium
```

Ensure you have spinned up react, node servers & mongodb docker containers locally. If you have not, follow the `How to run frontend react, backend node, mongodb in dev mode or as docker containers` guide above.

under project root folder:

1. `cd e2eTests`
2. `npm run test:e2e`

If you raise a pr, Github Actions will trigger the `./github/workflow/ci.yml` workflow which runs all automated tests


# Q & A

### 1. sh command not found running npm commands

##### A: Please make sure you use Git Bash to run the command if you are on Windows

### 2. docker or docker-compose command not found

##### A: Please review `How to set up local development environment` section and install docker desktop.

##### A: Please make sure you use Git Bash to run the command if you are on Windows

### 3. For AWS CDK code getting error when running `npm run deploy-dev`

##### A: See `testing AWS CDK infrastructure as code` section for details

### 4. How do I access latest deployed website

##### A: We provision new EC2 instances if we have infrastructure change. Need to go to github actions to grab the latest working public DNS. Get it from the latest successful `CD` build from Github Actions
