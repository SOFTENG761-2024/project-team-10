        "My research is aimed at understanding how tourism can be a tool for sustainable development. Applying critical and community-engaged approaches, I explore how social entrepreneurship can make tourism an equitable and sustainable form of livelihood for local communities and subsequently create positive community change. Advocating for sustainable consumption in tourism, my research also examines the environmentally responsible behaviours of tourists. My other research interests include community development, geotourism and geopark development, and the decolonization of tourism knowledge production. I serve as Research Notes Editor for Tourism in Marine Environments, Media Engagement Editor for Tourism Management Perspectives, Review Editor for Frontiers in Sustainable Tourism, and Associate Editor for Advances in Southeast Asian Studies. Apart from academic research, I have been actively involved in practitioner-based research for tourism planning consultancy projects in the Philippines and New Zealand."

It spans across a range of topics such as firm\u2019s barriers to implementation of voluntary management schemes, studies into corporate social responsibility and business ethics.  More recently I have explored various aspects of standardization, namely the development of voluntary regulations such as social responsibility guidance standard ISO 26000, and aspects of adoption of standards at firm level. I have been especially interested in the assessment of effectiveness and success of policy instruments, evaluation of sustainability indicators which has been published in leading international peer-reviewed journals including Journal of Business Ethics, MIT Sloan Management Review (ranked amongst the top 45 management journals in the Financial Times FT 45 ranking), International Journal of Production Economics (A* ABDC), and in engineering journals such as Journal of Cleaner Production (A, ERA)."

In the human rights context, a major focus has been the impact of the UN's Universal Periodic Review mechanism, in both New Zealand and the Pacific Islands. In 2014, along with a group of enthusiastic students, Natalie coordinated a submission for New Zealand's second Universal Periodic Review at the UN Human Rights Council on the human rights impacts of the Canterbury earthquakes.
