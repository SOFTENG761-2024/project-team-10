        "My longstanding research interest has related to the effective treatment of sex and violent offenders. More specifically I have been fascinated by offender denial and acceptance of responsibility \u2013 notably the characteristics of denying sex offenders, the function or purpose of denial, its relationship (or otherwise) with risk of reoffending, and most interestingly how to effectively intervene when an offender maintains his innocence. More broadly, I have maintained an interest in the context of offender treatment. I have researched, and/or collaborated on, the effectiveness of group therapy as a treatment modality, how to generalise and maintain rehabilitative gains, when and how to use pharmaceutical treatments, and how to adapt rehabilitative efforts for offenders with disability. I have more recently expanded my research interest to the wider context of reducing reoffending. I have published on the effectiveness and use of therapeutic communities, the opportunities of using inmates as peer supporters, and have taken a particular interest in aspects of the therapeutic and rehabilitative climate in prisons and how this impacts desistance efforts. \n\nMy approach to research has, for the most part, reflected my desire to translate academic findings into simple pragmatic solutions for practitioners and policy makers. To this end, I have published literature reviews in high impact journals, empirical (quantitative) studies, chapters in textbooks, as well as case studies."

His current research interests are large scale physiological simulation, and high performance computing. Dr Zakkaroff is developing the Coupled Arterial Cells project. At its core, this project has a massively parallel, multi-scale framework for modelling paracrine signalling. The project focuses on the investigation of the relationship between micro-scale cellular dynamics and the resulting emergent macro-scale behaviour as it is exemplified by the growth of atherosclerotic plaques. This approach to the exploration of large-scale emergent behaviour is capable of providing invaluable insights into the onset of coronary heart disease. In silico simulations enable the rapid exploration and pruning of the parameter search space for the refinement and integration of micro-level models into biologically realistic macro-scale models. The in silico simulation provide the opportunity to perform physiological experiments which are impossible in the in vivo or in vitro settings."

        "Dr Paul Knott undertakes research, research supervision and publication in strategic management, strategy-as-practice, and innovation management. A central theme of his research is how strategy actors individually and collectively harness concepts, tools and materials as they undertake day-to-day practices aimed at consequential outcomes for their firms or organisations. This activity takes place across different levels and roles, and lends itself to a variety of primarily qualitative research methods. Recent focus areas within this theme have included individual strategists\u2019 navigation of nascent opportunities, strategy development processes across multi-unit firms, and collaboration in networks of small firms. This has entailed study of a number of different business and cultural contexts, including small high-technology ventures in Aotearoa New Zealand and the informal sector in sub-Saharan Africa. An area for future development is to explore the strategic management implications of new contexts that may arise progressively through climate change."

My doctoral research, for example, explored relationships of accountability within Ng\u0101i Tahu (my iwi) and Indigenous communities through decolonising methodologies.\n\nCurrently I am pursuing research projects related to Indigenous development in Aotearoa New Zealand and the Pacific, community economies in a regenerating Christchurch, democratic accountability in Aotearoa New Zealand and the role of accounting techniques and accountability relations in the dispossession of Indigenous lands, bodies and self-determining authority."

I am also interested in the degree to which public discourse influences the focus of biosecurity policy, and how the popular perception of biosecurity issues aligns with the reality of biosecurity policy.\n\nFinally, I am interested in legal education, specifically in how the increased use of online teaching and learning affects student success."

The first concerns  privacy of people's information and the second concerns behavioral and social aspects of IT use. My work has applications in business (e.g. Intelligent Applications, Digital Humans), health IT, and emergency management. I have also collaborated on projects in knowledge management, IT use in SMEs, and deception detection. \n\nI am particularly excited about research on the potentials, challenges, and impacts of new and emerging technologies on people and society - technologies include AI-enabled applications and biometrics. My work seeks insights into how individuals use IT (e.g. creative/innovative use, adapting to new technologies), and are impacted by IT (both positive and negative). \n\nWith over 3800 citations (h-index 21, i-index 31) and 80+ refereed articles my research has appeared in peer\u2010reviewed proceedings, edited books and journals including MIS Quarterly, Information and Management, Communications of the AIS, Journal of Knowledge Management, Business Process Management Journal, Information Systems Frontiers, and Journal of Travel & Tourism Marketing. \n\nI currently serve as Senior Editor for DATA BASE and for IT & People, as Section Editor for the Australian Journal of Information Systems, and Associate Editor for the Journal of Global Information Management. \n\nIn 2020, I was a recipient of the AIS Fellow Award which recognizes individuals who have made outstanding contributions to the information systems discipline."

My work speaks to policymakers, captains of industry, and international entrepreneurs.\n\nPrior to embarking on a career in academia, I spent 10 years in industry where I held roles in international logistics and retail management.

        "My current research is divided into three areas:\n\n1. Corporate Governance and Executive Remuneration\nI am currently preparing manuscripts on board decision-making processes, executive remuneration policies and practices, disclosure of remuneration, and corporate governance codes of best practice.  These papers draw on data from New Zealand, Australia, United States of America and United Kingdom.\n\n2. Management Accounting\nI am currently preparing a manuscript on management accounting.  It presents evidence from a survey of NZ Chief Financial Officers, concerning the relevance of management accounting theories to practice.  This research finds that practitioners (CFOs) believe that management accounting theories should be taught and researched in universities and that these theories are practical relevant.  \n\n3. Accounting Education\nI am currently preparing manuscripts on the effectiveness of various  innovative teaching methods (e.g. the use of business simulation games and student-centred learning).  The research aims to understand which teaching methods produce the best learning outcomes for accounting students."

My teaching covers challenging topics included in the CFA exam Level 1, 2, 3 curricula, and helps students prepare to take the CFA exam. I have taught both undergraduate level (Fixed Income Securities, Investments) and postgraduate level (Equity Valuation, Portfolio Management, Credit Risk Management, Sustainable Finance). Being a CFA Charter-holder, I can award three scholarships to UC students to take the CFA exam each year.  Each scholarship offers waived enrollment fee and reduced exam registration fee of USD 400. \n\nMy research portfolio includes multi-disciplinary studies on culture, credit risk, portfolio management, and sustainability. My co-authored research has been published, for example, in the Journal of Financial Economics, Pacific-Basin Finance Journal, Journal of Derivatives, ABACUS, and JMIR Public Health and Surveillance. I led students to conduct research projects sponsored by Christchurch-based investment bank Northington Partners and financial advisory firm Bradley Nuttall (renamed Cambridge Partners), which resulted in refereed publications. \n\nI have been an Associate Editor of the Journal of Applied Accounting Research (published by Emerald) since 2020. I also served as a reviewer for selected Journals in Finance, Accounting, and Economics, and an external examiner of Masters thesis and Doctoral dissertation for Universities in New Zealand and Australia.\n\nBeing interested in financial education and giving back to the profession, I have been doing various volunteer work relating to the CFA exams, CFA Institute Research Challenge (New Zealand and Asia-Pacific rounds), practice analysis, and professional misconduct monitoring for the CFA Institute. I was the organiser/ academic adviser and led UC student team to the top three performers in the national CFA Institute Research Challenge for a number of years."

Examples include testing whether revenue sharing makes group liability microfinance work better for higher risk business start ups in developing countries, whether stakeholders in land and resource-use conflicts can successfully bargain to efficient solutions in place of government policy-setting, and whether environmental valuation techniques such as contingent valuation are reliable.  I am currently looking at how the efficiency achieved by pollution control policies typically favoured by economists can be undermined by their perceived inequity when the policies are weakly enforced."

In both she combines the domestic with the international and crosses boundaries among traditional legal subjects. Her approach is responsive to needs and issues arising in today\u2019s globalised, interlinked, and interdisciplinary world. Creating synergies between subject areas, disciplines and people has been one of her key and unique research strengths. Establishing the Institute of Small and Micro States (ISMS) as an independent think tank and delivering law reform guidance, inter alia for the Commonwealth Secretariat, evidences her research approach.\n\n\nORCID 0000-0002-8729-7059"

More recently I have explored various aspects of standardization, namely the development of voluntary regulations such as social responsibility guidance standard ISO 26000, and aspects of adoption of standards at firm level. I have been especially interested in the assessment of effectiveness and success of policy instruments, evaluation of sustainability indicators which has been published in leading international peer-reviewed journals including Journal of Business Ethics, MIT Sloan Management Review (ranked amongst the top 45 management journals in the Financial Times FT 45 ranking), International Journal of Production Economics (A* ABDC), and in engineering journals such as Journal of Cleaner Production (A, ERA)."

In the human rights context, a major focus has been the impact of the UN's Universal Periodic Review mechanism, in both New Zealand and the Pacific Islands. In 2014, along with a group of enthusiastic students, Natalie coordinated a submission for New Zealand's second Universal Periodic Review at the UN Human Rights Council on the human rights impacts of the Canterbury earthquakes.
