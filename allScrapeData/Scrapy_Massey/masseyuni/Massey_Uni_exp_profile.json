    "bio": "Simon Cope is a Senior Tutor in Marketing at Massey University since 2003. He completed his MBA with the University of Southern Cross in NSW, Australia in 2001. Prior to this, he acquired an NZCE in Computers & Engineering at Unitec after completing a 9000-hour apprenticeship as an electrician with the MOWD and getting Advanced Trade papers A, B, C, & D. While supervising three apprentices he realised that teaching can be fun! (The secret is to mix in lots of practical examples from real life with the theory and explain using Visual (spatial), Aural (auditory-musical), Verbal (linguistic), Physical (kinesthetic), Logical (mathematical), Social (interpersonal), & Solitary (intrapersonal) learning styles at every opportunity possible... When he is not teaching undergrad 115116 Intro to Marketing, 156235 Social & Digital Mktg,\u00a0 or 156339 Omnichannel Retail Mktg, he is teaching Post Grad 156756 Advanced Digital Mktg at Albany Campus (Internal & distance students), he is either; helping Massey University deliver the marketing component of their MBA program throughout NZ, or consulting with a wide variety of business owners to help improve their website from a marketing perspective. In all cases he is drawing upon his practical experience gained when he was an electrician for 5 years to then successfully creating a number of businesses over a 35 year period in various industries focused around sales and marketing - also drawing upon the theory and strategies gained through the MBA and endless self-learning. Simon is someone that thrives on learning new info... he has enjoyed studying towards a Cert in Early Childhood when developing a reward program/game that sold commercially around the world. With another venture Simon became a licenced real estate agent to help him develop a marketing program for agents and their licensees to use in 2005 onward. In 2000 Simon immersed himself in the world of direct marketing, infomercials, direct response advertising etc under the training of Dan Kennedy and Bill Glazer to create an online eCommerce store ProductsFromNZ.com selling the best of NZ made gifts and souvenirs worldwide...\u00a0 In 2013 Simon & his wife Kristina successfully sold ProductsFromNZ.com for 5x their asking price. 2016 Simon launched BlockingCard.com a simple device that protects your credit card & passport from fraud. Exponential sales meant a couple of epic road trips around the USA with the family + purchase of electric vehicles soon followed. As the product life-cycle on these wound down in 2020, Simon and his wife started working on CreatingDesignClarity.co.nz to help homeowners about to start a home renovation/room makeover be successful. Launched in Dec 2021 business is looking good! Why do I tell you all of this? Because I bring all of this into the classroom - the students are empowered, encouraged and kept up to date with the latest marketing techniques as well as learn how to apply and self-develop themselves as they leave Massey with their own destiny in their hands... Simon brings a strong mix of practical elements combined with solid theory to the classroom. \u00a0Having used his marketing knowledge to effectively market himself he then helped to grow a number of small business to the point of being sold as viable ongoing profitable entities. He then did an MBA specializing in direct marketing to further his education....",

I have been a high school teacher, journalist, youth worker, live and recorded performance producer and director, media production manager and writer, academic coach for secondary and tertiary students, director of a large local and national youth organisation, board member of community development organisations, event organiser, social justice advocate for immigrant communities and diverse sexual orientation and gender identity communities. All of these contribute to my goal of creating meaningful learning experiences for students in their studies of workplace communication. I have been part of a small intiative to promote a cross-cultural understanding of critical thinking in post-graduate programmes as a way of enhancing the experience of international students and teaching staff in these programmes. I completed my PhD  in 2023 with the School of Communication, Journalism, and Marketing. I am a member of the Te Kura Whai Pakihi Kai\u0101rahi Tiriti o Te Kunenga ki P\u016brehuroa team helping colleagues explore what it means to be Te Tiriti-led in our teaching, research, and citizenship. I enjoy creating interactive learning activities that engage students in discovering knowledge and working out how to apply it. My students have nominated me for Lecturer of the Year every year since I started at Massey. I love teaching and researching. Since 2017, I have been teaching workplace communication at undergraduate and postgraduate levels. After 45 years experience in community youth work and media production, I have recently moved into academia to pursue my interest in intercultural communication. For the past 20 years, I have been involved in social justice advocacy for immigrant young people and LGBTIQ* communities and I am interested in exploring the field of social advocacy  . My PhD project studied perceptions of cultural inclusivity in communication in organisations.",

I have managed several government-funded research projects into adult literacy including work with the Ministry of Health, Ministry of Education, the Department of Labour, and the Health Research Council/Ministry of Health, where I began investigating health literacy and health communication issues around immunisation. My background lies within the mental health sector where she worked as a Specialist Services Co-ordinator, establishing links with community resources and groups, and healthy living programmes for high-risk clients. My PhD study incorporated quantitative and qualitative methods and investigated the ways in which people in adult vocational courses of differing literacy levels cope with and make meaning of stressful learning encounters, and the impacts this has on persistence. Recent work has involved trialling an immunisation communication resource within five District Health Board regions and assessing its effectiveness in increasing health professional confidence in discussing immunisation, client uptake of information, and client uptake of infant immunisation services. I have also recently completed some exploratory research into maternal mental load and vaccination coverage in the media.\u00a0 I am enthralled by psychology and human behaviour and bring these interests into my own research programme in health communication (particularly in the area of infant feeding, vaccination, and maternal mental health messages), stress and coping, and interpersonal communication. I have worked in the mental health field as a Specialist Services Coordinator and before I became a lecturer, was a full-time Project Manager of a large collaborative multi-city university-community research team. I enjoy working with both qualitative and quantitative data, and love when I can mix both in the same project!",

Empirical evidence suggests that \u2018government initiatives\u2019 and institutional \u2018finance\u2019 are important influencers of the decision to adopt PV power supply systems in developing countries. In order to diffuse PV technology it is also necessary to provide decision-makers with opportunities for direct and vicarious experience of PV systems through \u2018demonstration sites\u2019. These factors were ignored in earlier models of the innovation\u2013decision process formulated by Rogers and the new innovation-decision framework proposed by Kaplan. Governments need to play a leadership role, and this coupled with the availability of Finance and Demonstration Sites will result in an increased interest leading to the adoption of PV technology in India.
