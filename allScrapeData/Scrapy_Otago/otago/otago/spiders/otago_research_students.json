However, it is advised in literature to pay more attention to the social dimension of sustainability, as it is being neglected throughout literature and practice, despite societies importance for creating awareness about the danger the globe is facing, in addition to increase the acceptance rate of sustainable products, as well as promoting sustainability through encouraging non-sustainable companies to seek sustainability to respond to societies pressure. Therefore, throughout this study, we aim to address the social dimension in a circular economy, propose a notion for the contribution of the circular economy to the society and vice versa, in collaboration with stakeholders from different levels and sectors.",

By capturing the university lives of third-year and final-year undergraduate students in New Zealand, this study investigates the lived experiences of a range of support systems to be involved in building resilience and differentiates these layers of support among different social styles of Bachelor students. Finally, the study explores the meaning of resilience from students' perspective and highlights its role as one of contributing factors to sustaining student wellbeing in the educational journey",

However, consumers are limited in their ability to do so in an online retail environment. In an attempt to address these limitations of the online retail channel, developments in technology have been utilised in a new form of e-commerce called live streaming, which enables consumers to view and listen to a live streamer explain what the product feels, smells and looks like. Therefore, the current research aims to investigate whether the social presence of a live streamer (i.e. seller) acts as a sensory proxy for the viewer (i.e. consumer) to psychologically trial a product, increasing immersion through narrative transportation, and thus increasing purchase intention in a live stream shopping context.",

The widespread use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology and its human-like characteristics not only transformed the way people perceive and interact with them but also challenged the nature of the service interface from being human-driven technology dominant. Considering the initial success of the AI powered service robots, there is significant interest in extending the usage of robotics and virtual assistants in a wider range of service situations. Therefore, having a better understanding of how and why the specific feature of service robots affect consumer reactions toward service encounters is crucial. Thus, my study aims to explore whether Artificial Intelligence Assistants are likely to be the preferred service delivery mechanism over human by considering customers' negative reactions.",

Apart from using humanlike AI agents to foster interactions with customers in service settings and customers' personal settings, firms have also focused on integrating such nonhumans into their online business strategy. In this regard, value-generating interactions are no longer limited to human-human interactions only but can also include human-machine interactions. Notwithstanding the ability of AI agents to integrate resources with human actors, the existing technology-mediated cocreation is still predominantly limited to a discussion of humans as actors, whereas machines were recognized as a medium for facilitating resource integration between human actors. Against this backdrop, I endeavour to understand how AI agents integrate resources with customers in cocreating value.",

It is proposed as a capability that enables firms to anticipate, respond to, and recover from disruptions, allowing them to continue their operations.
